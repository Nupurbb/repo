When I was younger I played alot more of singles at tournaments but now transitioning into high school tennis, I play more doubles.

## Problems

- Making the make command work: the command was periodically working and not that reliable to use so instead we started using bundle exec jekyll serve but after reinstalling the new make command it started working again
- Also another challenge we faced was making sure that all the commands were installed because a lot of times the commands kept showing errors despite being continously installed 
- to fix this we rebooted the computer and cleaned up our vs code and it ended up working after that
- Another issue was that my partner was on windows and I was using a mac which made it difficult for us to help each other but we became more familiar with each other's laptops.
- BUT with an AGILE MINDSET and the idea that nothing is too difficult to achieve we persevered through all the issues we faced.

I'm thrilled to stand before you today to introduce a revolutionary tool that has the power to change the way we think about our impact on the environment. It's called the Carbon Footprint Finder Score App.

[Slide 1: Title - Carbon Footprint Finder Score App]

Student Speaker: Before I delve into the app, let's address a pressing concern - Climate Change. You might ask, "Why is Climate Change such an important issue?" Well, that's exactly where our journey begins.

[Slide 2: Importance of Climate Change]

Student Speaker: Climate Change is the defining challenge of our time. It's not just about melting ice caps or extreme weather events; it's about the very future of our planet. Here's why it's so important:

Environmental Impact: Climate change leads to rising sea levels, biodiversity loss, and increased natural disasters. It's a direct threat to the beauty and diversity of our world.

Economic Consequences: It affects economies globally, impacting agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure. The cost of inaction is enormous.

Health Implications: Climate change has adverse effects on public health. Heatwaves, changing disease patterns, and air pollution are just a few examples.

Social Justice: It exacerbates inequalities, affecting vulnerable communities disproportionately. Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it's a social justice issue.

Global Responsibility: It's a global problem. Our actions today affect people in distant corners of the world, and likewise, their actions affect us.

[Slide 3: Carbon Footprint Finder Score App]

Student Speaker: Now, let me introduce you to a tool that empowers individuals to combat climate change on a personal level - the Carbon Footprint Finder Score App.

[Slide 4: App Features]

Student Speaker: This app is designed to help you measure your personal carbon footprint, which is the total amount of greenhouse gases you produce. It does so by tracking various aspects of your life, such as your transportation choices, energy consumption, and dietary habits. Let me highlight some of the key features:

Easy-to-Use Interface: The app is user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible for all.

Personalized Recommendations: Based on your data, the app provides tailored suggestions to reduce your carbon footprint.

Progress Tracking: You can see how your choices impact your carbon footprint over time, fostering a sense of responsibility.

Education: The app provides educational content, ensuring users understand the environmental consequences of their actions.

[Slide 5: How the App Fights Climate Change]

Student Speaker: But you might be wondering, "How does this app really help combat climate change?"

[Slide 6: Mitigation and Awareness]

Student Speaker: The Carbon Footprint Finder Score App addresses the climate crisis in several ways:

Personal Action: By monitoring and reducing your carbon footprint, you directly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Collective Impact: When more people use the app, we collectively reduce emissions on a significant scale.

Awareness: It fosters awareness about climate change and the role of individual actions, promoting a culture of sustainability.

[Slide 7: Conclusion]

Student Speaker: In conclusion, climate change is a critical issue with far-reaching implications. However, we have the power to make a difference. The Carbon Footprint Finder Score App is your tool to take action, reduce your environmental impact, and join the global movement to combat climate change.

[Slide 8: Call to Action]

Student Speaker: I invite you all to download the app, join the fight against climate change, and become a part of the solution. Together, we can build a more sustainable and resilient future for ourselves and generations to come.

[Closing]

Student Speaker: Thank you for your attention, and let's take this opportunity to be the change we want to see in the world. Together, we can make a difference!
