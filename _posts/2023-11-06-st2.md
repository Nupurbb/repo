   this was on algorithoms:     •  
     Definition: A finite set of instructions to accomplish a task     •   
      string Algorithims    
       •    Palindrome: takes user input and converts to a palindrome by duplicating the string backwards. Users can choose to duplicate last character or not.    
        •    Constraints: defaults to no duplication unless user types exactly “yes”    
         •    A palindrome string or number is the same read forwards or backwards. Simple as that. Ex. “bob” “hannah” 1337331 9 Homework: input_string = “racecar” reversed_string = input_string[::-1] print(reversed_string, “is a palindrome”) mystr = str(input(“racecar: “)) mybool = input(“Would you like to make a palindrome with this string?”).lower() if mybool == “yes”: secondstr = mystr[::-1] else: secondstr = mystr[:-1] secondstr = secondstr[::-1] endresult = mystr+secondstr print(endresult) array = [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2] array.sort() print(array)
