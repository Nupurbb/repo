### PBL Unit 2 / 1 Week 6: 

JS Basics test, This is week we worked on javascript and had hacks to complete for the test. We learned how to do hacks with python, javascript and html to look at what each one does for the inputs and outputs. I think i deserve a 3.9/4 on this test. this is because I worked alot and spent many hours by myself and also working with my team on this. I learned about creative ways to add these hacks and I did lots of debugging. I completed all the required hacks and added more and made the required hacks more innovative.
peer review from Prakruti: I give Nupur a 3.95/4. She did a great job explaining everything in a way showing she knew how everythibg worked and knew the code very well. She did all the required hacks correct. She added several more hacks and made creative games with the hacks.Score based on rubriv: +0.5, +0.5, +0.45+, 0.5,+.1, +1=3.95/4. feedbac: try to debug something else other that what was given for teacher repo.
