### Week 6 review ticket
This week we did alot of working on fixing our page with the design aspect. We wathed online tutorials and used chat to learn how to kinda restart and change evrything. We also learned how to use aws, ubuntu and learned about the seperate backend and frontend. Me amd my partner started looking into apis to use for our next review.
