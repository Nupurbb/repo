### Quiz Reflection/Review ans score
Score: On the quiz I got a 60/66



1) Which of the following can be used to replace missing code so that the code segment works as intended?
 My answer: D
 Correct answer: B
 Reason: This option is incorrect. The code segment never changes the value of second.
 Reflection: The reason for my incorrect response lies in my oversight during the evaluation of the code segment. I mistakenly assumed that option D was the correct choice without thoroughly considering the code's functionality. This experience has taught me the importance of careful code analysis and not making hasty assumptions when selecting answers.

 9) Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?
 My answer: It allows programmers to implement algorithmic solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems.
Correct answer: It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program.
Reason: Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
Reflection: My answer illustrates my initial misunderstanding of the benefits of an iterative and incremental process in program development. I mistakenly thought it was primarily about implementing algorithmic solutions, but the correct answer highlights the importance of identifying errors as new components are added to a working program. This experience reinforces the significance of thorough comprehension and aligning my responses with the specific context of the question.

52) Grades in a computer science course are based on total points earned on a midterm exam and a final exam. The teacher provides a way for students to improve their course grades if they receive high scores on the final exam: if a student’s final exam score is greater than the student’s midterm exam score, the final exam score replaces the midterm exam score in the calculation of total points.

The table below shows two students’ scores on the midterm and final exams and the calculated total points each student earns.

A table is shown with 4 columns and 3 rows. The first row of the table contains the column headers, from left to right, Student Name, Midterm Exam Score, Final Exam Score, Total Points Calculation. The table is as follows: Khalil, 90, 80, 90 plus 80 equals 170 Josefina, 70, 90, 90 plus 90 equals 180

Khalil does better on the midterm exam than on the final exam, so his original midterm and final exam scores are added to compute his total points.
Josefina does better on the final exam than on the midterm exam, so her final exam score replaces her midterm exam score in the total points calculation.
A programmer is writing a procedure to calculate a student’s final grade in the course using the score replacement policy described. The student’s exam scores are stored in the variables One word, midterm Exam and One word, final Exam. The procedure Max, open parenthesis, a comma b returns the larger of a and b.

Which of the following could be used in the procedure to calculate a student’s total points earned in the course and store the result in the variable One word, adjusted Total ?
My answer: One word, adjusted Total, left arrow, Max, open parenthesis, one word midterm Exam, comma, one word final Exam, close parenthesis
Correct answer: One word, adjusted Total, left arrow, Max, open parenthesis, one word midterm Exam, comma, one word final Exam, close parenthesis, plus one word final Exam
Reason: This expression uses theMax procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, adjusted Total.
Reflection: My initial response demonstrates my understanding of the process described in the question. However, I neglected to add the final exam score after selecting the higher score between the midterm and final exams in my response. The correct answer highlights the importance of not only replacing the midterm score but also correctly calculating the adjusted total by adding the final exam score. This experience reinforces the significance of precise and complete coding in programming scenarios.

31) The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom right square of the grid and facing toward the top of the grid.

The figure shows a grid of squares with 5 columns and 5 rows. The bottom right square of the grid contains an upward-facing triangle, representing a robot. The top left square of the grid is shaded gray. All other squares are white.

The following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure One word, Goal Reached, which returns true if the robot is in the gray square and returns 

false otherwise.
Program I: The block code consists of 5 lines. Begin block Line 1: REPEAT 4 TIMES Begin block Line 2, indented 1 tab: MOVE underscore FORWARD Line 3, indented 1 tab: ROTATE underscore LEFT Line 4, indented 1 tab: MOVE underscore FORWARD Line 5, indented 1 tab: ROTATE underscore RIGHT End block End blockProgram II: The block code consists of 5 lines. Begin block Line 1: REPEAT UNTIL, begin block, Goal Reached, 1 word with capital G and R, end block Begin block Line 2, indented 1 tab: IF, begin block, CAN underscore MOVE, begin block, forward, end block, end block Begin block Line 3, indented 2 tabs: MOVE underscore FORWARD End block Line 4, indented 1 tab: ELSE Begin block Line 5, indented 2 tabs: ROTATE underscore LEFT End block End block End block

Which of the following statements is true?
My answer: Neither program I nor program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square.
Correct answer:Both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square.
Reason:  Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.
Reflection: My initial response indicated a misunderstanding of the programs presented in the question. Upon further analysis, it is evident that both Program I and Program II are indeed designed to move the robot to the gray square successfully. This experience highlights the importance of careful examination of program logic to ensure a more accurate evaluation of their functionality.


42) Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) represents each IP address as a 32-bit binary number. Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents each IP address as a 128-bit binary number. Which of the following best describes the result of using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses?
My answer: 2 to the fourth power times as many addresses are available.
Correct answer: 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many addresses are available.
Reason:  With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2 raised to the thirty second power possible addresses. With 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power possible addresses. Since 2 raised to the thirty second power times 2 raised to the ninety sixth power equals 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power, IPv6 has 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many possible addresses as IPv4.
Reflection: My initial response underestimated the magnitude of the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 address space. The correct answer accurately represents the vast increase in the number of available addresses in IPv6, emphasizing that there are 2 to the ninety sixth power times as many addresses available. This experience highlights the significance of understanding the implications of address space expansion in different Internet protocols.
