## Natm
 Through this trimester, our team wanted our cpt project to be something that would be useful and helpful to everyone and something that was relatable and important to us. We made a fitness website but be encountered many problems with linking to backend that we worked through in order to get to Natm.
## Feautures I worked on
 Login/Signup
 Style of Frontpage
 Fitness Recs feauture- linked to backend database
## Connections to CPT rubric
## 1. Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file.
 This was done through the user inputting their login info and fitness info and it being stored through backend.

## 2. Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collectino of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose.

## 3. An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
procedure Fitness_data(Fitness):
initialize empty list result
for each item in data:
if item meets certain condition:
perform action based on condition
append result of action to result list
return result
