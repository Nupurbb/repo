### Tri 1 Review Ticket
Reflecting on this tri of CSP, I think I came a long way. I first learned about all the different applications that I can add on my laptop. Then I learned how to create a blog. I leaerned alot about how to use HTML and CSS and how to make things more visually appealing. I was a backend worker this tri, so I am really proud of myself for becoming more familiar with python, javascript ans apis.

Computational Thinking and Problem Solving:
One of the most profound aspects of this course has been the development of computational thinking. I've learned how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and develop algorithms to solve them. This skill not only applies to computer science but has also improved my problem-solving abilities in other areas of my life.

The Power of Coding:
Learning to code has been an eye-opening experience. It's incredible to see how a few lines of code can create powerful applications, solve real-world problems, and automate repetitive tasks. This newfound skill has given me the confidence to explore a wide range of projects and has opened up a world of creative possibilities.

The Importance of Data:
Understanding the role of data in our digital world has been a central theme of the CSP course. I've learned how data is collected, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions. It's made me more critical of the data I encounter in everyday life and has deepened my appreciation for data privacy and security.

Collaboration and Communication:
The collaborative nature of this course has taught me the value of working with others. Through group projects, discussions, and peer feedback, I've realized that effective communication and teamwork are essential not only in computer science but in any field or endeavor.

Ethical Considerations:
CSP has also brought ethical considerations to the forefront. I've had to think critically about the ethical implications of technology and data use. Learning to make responsible choices as a digital citizen is something I will carry with me throughout my life.

A Growth Mindset:
AP CSP has challenged me to persevere through difficult concepts and problem-solving tasks. This has reinforced the idea that with effort and a growth mindset, I can overcome any challenge. It's a lesson that extends far beyond the world of computer science.

In conclusion, the AP CSP course has been a transformative experience that has not only deepened my understanding of computer science but also enhanced my problem-solving skills, taught me the value of collaboration, and instilled in me a sense of responsibility as a digital citizen. It's a journey that has not only prepared me for future studies and potential careers in the tech field but has also enriched my personal growth in countless ways. I am grateful for this experience and excited to continue exploring the vast world of computer science and technology.
