    "1. Which of the following IP Addresses are possible? Explain (yes/no) for each answer choice.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - 1.1.1.1.1: Not a valid IP address. An IP address consists of four sets of numbers ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods. This format doesn't conform to the standard IPv4 structure.\n",
    " - 23.23.23.23: Possible. It's a valid IPv4 address following the correct format.\n",
    " - 134.492.100.0: Not possible. The second number in the address (492) exceeds the valid range (0-255).\n",
    " - 255.256.55.255: Not possible. The second number in the address (256) exceeds the valid range (0-255).\n",
    " - 2.93.255.19: Possible. It's a valid IPv4 address following the correct format.\n",

    "2. If Dian Du is at home on his home network and sends a message to every computer on the network, what is this an example of? Explain.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Multicast\n",
    "- Unicast\n",
    "- Broadcast\n",
    "it's an example of broadcast. Broadcast communication sends data to all devices on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "1. Three of the four following protocols are on the same layer. Identify which ones and what layer they are on, and why they are on each layer:\n",
    "    - ASCII (see above for information):  Not a protocol but a character encoding standard. It's not associated with a particular layer in the OSI model.\n",
    "    - FTP (facilitates transfer of files over the internet): Operates at the Application Layer (Layer 7) as it deals with file transfer functions.\n",
    "    - TLS (see HTTPS section): Functions at the Transport Layer (Layer 4), providing secure communication between applications.\n",
    "    - USB (permits data exchange between electronics): Not a network protocol; it's a physical interface that permits data exchange between electronic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Telnet is a internet protocol which allows remote access to other computers over a local network or the internet. What layer of the OSI model would this protocol be located on? What is the function of this layer?\n",
    "Telnet operates at the Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. This layer facilitates user interfaces and network applications.\n",
    "#### DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob wants to use the domain bob.is.the.best.com. What domain should he buy from a DNS provider (assume it is available)? What would be the subdomains?\n",
    "Bob should buy the domain best.com. The subdomains would be bob.is.the.\n",
    "#### HTTP and HTTPS\n",
    "1. What is a difference between HTTP and HTTPS? : HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data, while HTTP does not.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - What protocol does HTTPS use that HTTP doesn't?: HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), providing encryption and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Last trimester we sent HTTP requests for our passion projects\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - Did we use HTTP or HTTPS?: HTTP\n",
    " - What are the benefits and disadvantages of this?: Advantages are that it is faster as https does ssl tsl encyrpytion.Disadvantages are lack of security and encryption, making data vulnerable to interception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP and UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob is setting up a video streaming service, and he needs the stream to be real time. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - What protocol should he use, TCP or UDP? Why?\n",
    " - What are some cons of this protocol? Give an example of a potential issue.\n",
    "Bob should use UDP for real-time streaming because it's fast but doesn't check for errors or resend lost data, which might cause some packets to be lost or create errors in the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TCP has error checking, which ensures that all packets arrive properly. Why is this important?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - Give an example of how TCP ensures that there are no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    " TCP's error checking ensures data integrity during transmission by using acknowledgment and retransmission. For instance, if a packet is lost, TCP retransmits it until it's successfully received.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Server A computer is communicating with Server B. They have already initiated communication and Server A is now attempting to send data to Server B.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - How does Server B ensure that they have received any sent packets before Server A continues sending packets in TCP? In UDP?\n",
    " - What is another use of this?\n",
    "\n",
    " Server B sends acknowledgment (ACK) packets to Server A for each received packet, ensuring their successful reception before Server A continues sending more data.\n",
    "Another use of acknowledgment in TCP is for flow control, regulating the rate of data transmission between Server A and Server B.In UDP, there's no built-in acknowledgment system. Server B doesn't explicitly confirm received packets. There's no assurance that Server A's packets are received before Server A continues sending more data. There isn't an additional use of acknowledgment in UDP because it does not have the feauture."
